# C code for MCMC for Bayesian logistic regression

Building the C code assumes a Unix-like development environment. Typing `make` should build and run the code. The only vaugely non-standard dependency is the [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). On Debian-derived Linux distributions, this is provided by the package `libgsl-dev`. On other distros the package will have a similar name.
