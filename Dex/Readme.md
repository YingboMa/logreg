# Dex examples

Note that these examples require a very recent Dex installation. In particular, they rely on the function `parseString`, which was added to the Prelude on 2022-07-06.

Note that when building Dex, it is better to build with `make build-opt` rather than just `make`.

There is a `Makefile`, so everything should run simply by typing `make`.
