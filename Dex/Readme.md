# Dex examples

Note that these examples require a very recent Dex installation. In particular, they rely on the function `parseString`, which was added to the Prelude on 2022-07-06.

There is a `Makefile` in this directory, so if you have a full Dex installation, everything should run simply by typing `make`.
