# Bayesian logistic regression in Haskell


The Haskell code builds using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). `stack` is the Haskell equivalent of Scala's `sbt. `stack` should manage all necessary dependencies, including Haskell itself.


```bash
stack build && stack exec lr-exe
```

For convenience, a `Makefile` is also included, so just typing `make` should work if `stack` is installed.
